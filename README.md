Excited to share my project – a TripAdvisor-inspired travel website built using HTML and CSS!
This website features beautifully structured travel destinations, user reviews, and a clean, intuitive layout.
I focused on creating a responsive design that adapts well across devices, offering a smooth user experience.
From header navigation to destination cards, every element was hand-coded with precision.
This project helped me enhance my frontend skills and practice real-world website structuring.
I also experimented with styling techniques to bring a modern, travel-friendly aesthetic.
Creating this clone taught me the importance of layout consistency and visual hierarchy.
It’s a static site but with potential for future dynamic features and backend integration.
